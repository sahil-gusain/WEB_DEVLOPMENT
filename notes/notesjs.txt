A closure is created when a function is defined inside another function,
and the inner function references variables in the outer function's scope. 
When the inner function is returned from the outer function, it retains a 
reference to the outer function's scope, and can continue to access those 
variables even after the outer function has finished executing.
 Vice-Versa is not true!!
