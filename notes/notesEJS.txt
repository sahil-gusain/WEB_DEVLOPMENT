modules in javascript are smallest units of independent , reuseable code that
can be used as building blocks for various projects

importing a library: we use require function to import a particular library.we have 
to set up the path for the library

exporting a library : we use export keyword for making feature of one module available
in the other file

instead of using for loops we can use forEach function in javascript
 for example:-
   const numbers = [1,2,3,4];
   numbers.forEach(myfunc);

   function myfunc(nums){
    console.log(nums);
   }

   numbers.forEach(function(nums){
    console.log(nums);
   });
