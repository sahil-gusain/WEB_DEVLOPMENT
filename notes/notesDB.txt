Databases are classified in two categories structured query language(sql) based
and not only structured query language(nosql)

MySql based is old and nosql based is new and shiny.More structured and requires 
the scheme whereas nosql is more flexiable and document based

SQL commands are based on crud technique:

C : create : create table customer(id INT,name varchar(11),address varchar(20));
r : read : select * from customer where id=1;
u : Update : Update customer set name = 'sahil' where id=1;
             alter table customer add email varchar(20);
d : delete : delete customer where id = 1;


mongoose : ODM
