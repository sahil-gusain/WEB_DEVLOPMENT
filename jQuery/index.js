//jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library.
//document.querySelector(".drum") is replaced by $(".drum") and jQuery(".drum")


$("h1").css("color","red");

//sometimes when we link jquery in the head it might take much longer to execute hence,
//ready function is used or script link is provided in the beginning 
//$("document").ready(function(){
//     $("h1").css("color","red");
// })
